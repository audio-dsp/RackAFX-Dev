Description:

************
	
This is port of Gverb reverb. Gverb source code can be freely found on the internet. 
As opposed to some of our more advanced reverbs, as the one found in Simple sampler, GVerb internal architecture is rather simple, but still sounds good.        

The original code did not support sample-rate scaling. Rather that trying to change the code, high-quality resampling to target-rate was added.  
The plugin will work best and use minimum CPU at native 44100 sample rate, when no resampling is perfomed.
