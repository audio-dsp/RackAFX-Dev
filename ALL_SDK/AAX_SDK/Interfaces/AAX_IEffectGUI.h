/** @brief	The interface for a %AAX Plug-in's user interface.
	
	@details
	@pluginimp

	This is the interface for an instance of a plug-in's GUI that gets exposed to 
	the host application.  You need to inherit from this interface and override all 
	of the virtual functions to create a plug-in GUI. 

	To create the GUI for an %AAX plug-in it is required that you inherit from 
	this interface and override all of the virtual functions from 
	\ref AAX_IACFEffectGUI.  In nearly all cases you will be able to take advantage of 
	the implementations in the %AAX library's \ref AAX_CEffectGUI class and only override the 
	few specific methods that you want to explicitly customize.
	
	\note This class always inherits from the latest version of the interface and thus requires any 
	subclass to implement all the methods in the latest version of the interface.
