	// is being created, this is necessary to ensure that the inner
	// object is Addrefed, not the outer object. Also note that 
	// the outer object must request IUnknown as the initial 
	// interface. This is mandated by the COM Specification.
	// If the outer object could request any initial interface, then
	// the inner object would essentially need to keep two duplicate
	// sets of vptrs, one set that delegated its QueryInterface, 
	// AddRef, and Release implementations and another set that did
	// not. By restricting the initial interface to IUnknown, the 
	// object implementor needs to isolate only the one vptr to act
	// as the non delegating IUnknown." (p. 194, "Essential COM", by
