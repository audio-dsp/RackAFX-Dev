/** @brief Interface to represent a plug-in binary's static description
	
	@details	
	\hostimp
	
	The \ref AAX_ICollection interface provides a creation function for new plug-in descriptors, 
	which in turn provides access to the various interfaces necessary for describing a plug-in. 
	When a plug-in description is complete, it is added to the collection via the \ref AddEffect
	method.	The \ref AAX_ICollection interface also provides some additional description methods that
	are used to describe the overall plug-in package. These methods can be used to describe the
	plug-in	package's name, the name of the plug-in's manufacturer, and the plug-in package
	version.
	
	\legacy The information in AAX_ICollection is roughly analogous to the information
	provided by CProcessGroup in the legacy plug-in library
