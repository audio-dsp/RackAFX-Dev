Demo\+M\+I\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Sampler\+: No audio on right channel (multi-\/mono)

Resolution\+: This bug is fixed as of A\+A\+X S\+D\+K 2.\+2.\+0

Discussion\+: Demo\+M\+I\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Sampler and Demo\+M\+I\+D\+I\+\_\+\+Synth are now restricted to not use multi-\/mono, via the \hyperlink{a00283_a6571f4e41a5dd06e4067249228e2249ea83f671685958bdc668ef574d5a2d92b0}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+e\+Property\+\_\+\+Constraint\+\_\+\+Multi\+Mono\+Support} property.

In Pro Tools, when a track\textquotesingle{}s M\+I\+D\+I destination is set to \char`\"{}none\char`\"{} and a new plug-\/in that includes a M\+I\+D\+I input node (e.\+g. any Instrument plug-\/in) is instantiated, the track\textquotesingle{}s M\+I\+D\+I destination is set to the first newly created M\+I\+D\+I input node.

When the track in question is greater than mono, and the Instrument plug-\/in is multi-\/mono, the default behavior is for the track\textquotesingle{}s M\+I\+D\+I destination to be set to the first of the newly created input nodes, not to all of them simultaneously. As a result, the track\textquotesingle{}s M\+I\+D\+I destination is set to the M\+I\+D\+I input node of the first (left) multi-\/mono instance of the plug-\/in.

To route M\+I\+D\+I to all channels of a multi-\/mono plug-\/in in Pro Tools, ctrl-\/select the M\+I\+D\+I destination and choose the additional M\+I\+D\+I nodes.\hypertarget{a00374_AAXSDK-186}{}\subsubsection{A\+A\+X\+S\+D\+K-\/186}\label{a00374_AAXSDK-186}

Misleading warning message when attempting hardware debugging using a non-\/local T\+I\+Shell.\+out

A\+A\+X Demo\+Gain\+\_\+\+V\+S\+T and Demo\+Gain\+\_\+\+Cocoa require initial click on G\+U\+I to take focus before editing (O\+S X)

Resolution\+: This bug is not yet resolved. For O\+S X, one workaround is to modify V\+S\+T\+G\+U\+I\textquotesingle{}s cocoasupport.\+mm file in order to add a handler for the accepts\+First\+Mouse selector\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{static} BOOL VSTGUI\_NSView\_acceptsFirstMouse(
  \textcolor{keywordtype}{id} \textcolor{keyword}{self},
  \textcolor{keywordtype}{SEL} \_cmd)
\{
  \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} YES;
\}

\textcolor{comment}{// In VSTGUI\_NSView\_isOpaque()}
res = class\_addMethod(
  viewClass,
  \textcolor{keyword}{@selector}(acceptsFirstMouse:),
  IMP (VSTGUI\_NSView\_acceptsFirstMouse),

A\+A\+X S\+D\+K\+: Incorrect output from scatter/gather D\+M\+A example plug-\/in when increasing playback buffer size while audio is present (Native decks)

Resolution\+: This bug is unresolved

Workaround\+: The workaround for this issue is to not run audio through this plug-\/in while increasing the playback buffer size.\hypertarget{a00374_AAXSDK-5}{}\subsubsection{A\+A\+X\+S\+D\+K-\/5}\label{a00374_AAXSDK-5}
\hyperlink{a00014_a25fc41a1060445db4d7bee7a2919460d}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Chunk\+Data\+Parser\+::\+Load\+Chunk} doesn\textquotesingle{}t handle unknown chunk items well

Resolution\+: This bug will not be fixed

Discussion\+: \hyperlink{a00014}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Chunk\+Data\+Parser} does not store the size of each chunk item in the data stream. Therefore there is no way to determine the correct size for each data element when reading a chunk that was generated by this parser.

Workaround\+: If you know the correct size of each data element in a chunk when it is read by the plug-\/in, you can override the \hyperlink{a00014}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Chunk\+Data\+Parser} methods to ensure that each data element is correctly sized.\hypertarget{a00374_AAXSDK-2}{}\subsubsection{A\+A\+X\+S\+D\+K-\/2 / A\+A\+X-\/648}\label{a00374_AAXSDK-2}

Some plug-\/ins\textquotesingle{} D\+S\+P Instance counts are much lower in Pro Tools 10.\+2 than in Pro Tools 10.\+1

Resolution\+: This issue affects plug-\/ins that employ more than one buffered data port and that support many instances per D\+S\+P chip on H\+D\+X. As of Pro Tools 10.\+2, there is a limit of 164 buffered data ports per D\+S\+P (this is equal to the total I/\+O limit per D\+S\+P.)

To work around this issue, use as few data ports in your plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s algorithm context as possible. Note that D\+M\+A transfers on H\+D\+X occur in 128-\/byte chunks, so packet sizes below 128 bytes do not increase transfer efficiency on H\+D\+X.

Groups do not follow changes to \char`\"{}\+Inserts\char`\"{} Globals group settings

Resolution\+: This bug will not be fixed

The workaround for this issue is to modify the group\textquotesingle{}s settings to de-\/select \char`\"{}follow globals\char`\"{}, then re-\/modify the group\textquotesingle{}s settings to select \char`\"{}follow globals\char`\"{}. This will apply the current Globals settings as well as any future changes to the Globals without need for additional workarounds.\hypertarget{a00374_RELENG-1484}{}\subsubsection{R\+E\+L\+E\+N\+G-\/1484}\label{a00374_RELENG-1484}

Optional analysis is not applied to every channel in a multi-\/channel selection

Resolution\+: This bug is fixed as of Media Composer 8.\+4

Discussion\+: When an optional analysis pass is triggered in Media Composer, only the channel that is currently represented in the Audio\+Suite Dialog will be analyzed. Other channels in a multi-\/channel selection will not be analyzed.

This issue is fixed in Media Composer 8.\+4; now the following behavior will occur for Audio\+Suite plug-\/ins\+:
