A\+A\+X Library core support for the A\+A\+X interface 

The A\+A\+X Library includes several built-\/in features that are designed to facilitate plug-\/in development and to make it easy to create plug-\/ins with correct and consistent behavior. Although these features are not a part of the A\+A\+X A\+P\+I, they are a core part of the S\+D\+K. \subsection*{Documents}
