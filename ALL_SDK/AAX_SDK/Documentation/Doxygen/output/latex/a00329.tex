\subsection{ }
The interface for a A\+A\+X Plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s user interface. 

The \hyperlink{a00098}{G\+U\+I interface} includes methods for handling the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s G\+U\+I window and events.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Accessing the window}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
In A\+A\+X, the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s window is provided as a native window pointer through the \hyperlink{a00117}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+I\+View\+Container} interface. The plug-\/in may also use this interface to forward events in its window back to the host for handling.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Default implementation}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
A default implementation of the G\+U\+I interface, \hyperlink{a00017}{A\+A\+X\+\_\+\+C\+Effect\+G\+U\+I}, is compiled in to the A\+A\+X library. This class includes a few helper methods and other extensions to the base interface. Of particular note are several additional pure virtual methods that are used by this class to extend the G\+U\+I A\+P\+I, and which must be overridden by any inheriting class.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Extensions}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The A\+A\+X S\+D\+K includes several examples of how the basic G\+U\+I interface may be extended to support native or third-\/party G\+U\+I frameworks. These examples are not a core part of the S\+D\+K, but are provided to developers as a convenience when incorporating their own chosen G\+U\+I framework. \subsection*{Classes}
