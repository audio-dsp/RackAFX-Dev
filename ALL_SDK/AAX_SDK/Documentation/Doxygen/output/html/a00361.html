About this document</h1>
<div class="section">This guide discusses specific details related to using AAX plug-ins with Media Composer, such as loading and initialization procedures, GUI hosting, and other application-specific features.</div><div class="section">For more information about the features, functionality, and use of Media Composer see the Media Composer user documentation. </div><div class="section"> </div><h1><a class="anchor" id="aax_media_composer_guide__processing_modes"></a>
Processing modes</h1>
<div class="section">Media Composer supports AAX plug-ins in two processing modes: AudioSuite and AAX Native </p><ul>
<li class="Bullet">
AudioSuite plug-ins perform non-real-time, random-access, file-based processing entirely on the host CPU.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
AAX Native plug-ins perform real-time, linear, non-destructive processing entirely on the host CPU. </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section">AAX plug-in processing in Media Composer is managed by specific Tools. Each of these Tools can be accessed using the "Tools" menu in the Media Composer application.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__media_composer_guide__audiosuite"></a>
Non-real-time processing (AudioSuite)</h2>
<div class="section"> Use the AudioSuite Tool to perform AudioSuite processing in Media Composer. The AudioSuite Tool applies an effect to a clip in the timeline of the record monitor.</div><div class="section">Specific AudioSuite plug-ins appear in the Plug-In Selection menu in the AudioSuite window.</div><div class="section"><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Unlike Pro Tools, the effect to clip relationship is remembered along with the effect parameters used. Parameters to the effects can be changed at a later time, and at any time the effect can be re-rendered with the saved effect parameters. Therefore it is very important for AudioSuite plug-ins to maintain compatibility between instances, versions, and systems in order to function properly in Media Composer workflows. See <a class="el" href="a00361.html#subsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__presets">Preset management</a> for more information.</dd></dl>
<p>Media Composer supports two AudioSuite processing modes: </p><ul>

<li>
Open the AudioSuite window by doing one of the following: <ul>
<li>
Select Tools &gt; AudioSuite  </li>
<li>
If an audio tool is already open, click the Effect Mode Selector menu and select AudioSuite  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Use the Track Selection Menu button to select the tracks that you want to modify. <ul>

AudioSuite Master Clip Mode</h3>
<div class="section"> Drag a Master Clip into the AudioSuite Tool to engage AudioSuite Master Clip Mode. This mode supports all AudioSuite effects, including those that change the width or length of the effected clip. A new Master Clip is generated for each AudioSuite processing pass applied in this mode.</div><div class="section">In Master Clip Mode, the AudioSuite window will be expanded to display additional controls. You can also click the Display/Hide Master Clip Controls button to display or hide the additional parameters.</div><div class="section">The following operations are available in Master Clip Mode: </p><ul>
<li class="Bullet">
Apply AudioSuite plug-ins to more than one track at the same time. For example, a plug-in might let you process two separate tracks as a stereo pair. This enables you to use plug-ins that perform linked compression, reverb, and other effects that allow multichannel input.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Create new media with a longer or shorter duration than the source media. This lets you use effects that perform time compression and expansion. For example, you can use a Time Compression Expansion plug-in to change the length of the audio file, or you can lengthen the file in order to add a reverb trail.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Apply one mono AudioSuite effect to multiple inputs of a master clip in a multiple-mono fashion.  </li>
</ul>

<li class="List">
Use a valid file name </li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__media_composer_guide__install_directories"></a>
Install directories</h2>
<div class="section"> AAX plug-ins must be installed in the system's AAX Plug-Ins directory. See <a class="el" href="a00372.html#aax_distributing_installer">Building your plug-in installer</a> for more information about creating a plug-in installer.</div><div class="section"><dl class="compatibility_notes"><dt><b><a class="el" href="a00380.html#_compatibility_notes000006">Host Compatibility Notes:</a></b></dt><dd>Some early versions of Media Composer 8 do not search the system plug-ins directory recursively.

</div><div class="section">Plug-ins that are uninstalled but still present on the system are placed into the "Plug-Ins (Unused)" directory, which is located next to the Plug-Ins directory.</div><div class="section">Media Composer will also search for a Plug-Ins directory next to the actual Media Composer application, and this directory will be used if present. This debug feature can be useful for testing specific plug-ins.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__media_composer_guide__file_name"></a>
Plug-in name and file structure</h2>
<div class="section"> In order to be recognized by AAE, all AAX plug-in bundles must use the ".aaxplugin" file name suffix. On OS X, the plug-in bundle must use this suffix while the binary itself does not require a suffix. On Windows, the plug-in binary (DLL) must use this suffix.</div><div class="section">The directory structure of an AAX plug-in bundle is also important. See <a class="el" href="a00331.html#commoninterface_formatspecification__aaxplugin_directory_structure">.aaxplugin Directory Structure</a> in the <a class="el" href="a00331.html">AAX Format Specification</a> document for more information.</div><div class="section"></div><div class="section"> </div><h1><a class="anchor" id="aax_media_composer_guide__features"></a>
AAX feature support in Media Composer</h1>
<div class="section"> Media Composer supports many of the same AAX features as Pro Tools. However, some features are not available in Media Composer, and other features are managed differently between the two applications. This section describes how Media Composer handles various optional AAX features.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__processing"></a>
Processing configurations</h2>
<div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">Sample rates</div><p> Media Composer operates at sample rates of 32000, 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000 Hz, as well as each rate's film pulldown version scaled by a ratio of 1000/1001: approximately 31968, 40959, 47952, 88111, 95904 Hz.</div><div class="section"><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The AAX API does not currently provide a selector for 32 kHz sample rate support</dd></dl>
<div class="SectionHead">Track formats</div><p> Media Composer supports only four track formats: </p><ul>
<li class="Bullet">
Mono </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Stereo (interleaved L/R)  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
5.1 surround in Pro Tools order (L, C, R, Ls, Rs, Lfe)  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
7.1 surround in Pro Tools order (L, C, R, Lss, Rss, Lsr, Lsr, Lfe)  </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section">Effects will only see these track formats on input.</div><div class="section"><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Plug-ins that support width-changing configurations between supported and unsupported track formats are not compatible with Media Composer</dd></dl>
<p>Channel ordering for plug-ins in Media Composer is identical to the channel ordering in Pro Tools. The channel ordering presentation to users may vary from the channel ordering that is used when sending audio buffers to Pro Tools; Media Composer re-orders channels to Pro Tools order prior to presenting the audio to the effect.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__presets"></a>
Preset management</h2>
<div class="section"> Media Composer stores plug-in presets in several locations within the app. Presets may be stored and accessed through the following workflows: </p><ul>
<li class="Bullet">
Presets can be stored in Media Composer bins by dragging the pink effect icon from the top of the effect editor window into a bin window.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Track effect presets are stored with their tracks in the sequence  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
AudioSuite presets are stored with their audio clips in the sequence  </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section">The storage of AudioSuite presets with clips in Media Composer is very different from Pro Tools. To ensure compatibility with Media Composer, it is very important that any AudioSuite effect can be re-rendered from the source media at any time.</div><div class="section"></div><h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__presets__persistence_notes"></a>
Plug-in preset compatibility and persistance</h3>
<div class="section"> It is always important to design AAX plug-in preset data in a way that will be compatible across different systems and at different points in time. This is particularly true when designing an AAX plug-in to be compatible with Media Composer.</div><div class="section">Media Composer sequences carrying presets can be exported as AAF, and these sequences may be moved freely between Media Composer systems on different operating systems and platforms. Therefore, it is important that plug-in preset data is not platform specific. A plug-in loaded in any given Media Composer system must be able to successfully read, parse, and apply preset information that was created on a different system.</div><div class="section">Presets also persist for a long time in sequences, so preset information should be formatted in a way that newer plug-ins can read older version's data, and older versions can read newer version's data.</div><div class="section">In addition, Media Composer 8.4 and higher can access factory presets and user-created presets interoperably with Pro Tools. A user can save a preset in one application, and access it in the other.</div><div class="section">These preset compatibility considerations also apply to plug-ins carried over from legacy plug-in formats such as TDM/RTAS. Media Composer 8.1 and higher (with 64-bit AAX support) will match plug-in IDs when loading sequence data saved with Media Composer 7 and below, which use older plug-in formats. The same system is used for matching plug-in IDs when moving presets between different versions of Pro Tools, and between Pro Tools and Media Composer: in all cases, a preset saved for a particular plug-in ID must be compatible with all other plug-ins that use that ID, regardless of the plug-in format.</div><div class="section"></div><h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__presets__comparison"></a>
Plug-in preset data comparison</h3>
<div class="section"> Media Composer's rendered AudioSuite effect feature relies on a comparison of plug-in settings chunk data. Unlike in Pro Tools, this operation uses direct data comparison rather than <a class="el" href="a00061.html#a1e86f849e970c9998313fc7d451ccf85">AAX_IEffectParameters::CompareActiveChunk()</a>. Therefore, Media Composer compatibility and proper operation of AudioSuite rendering in Media Composer depends on the plug-in having fully consistent AAX preset contents from one run to the next.</div><div class="section">Two specific areas where problems can occur are:</div><div class="section"><ul>
<li>Uninitialized memory in the preset chunk data</li>
<li>Floating point values in the preset chunk data</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section">Both of these can result in differences between settings chunks representing the same plug-in state, which causes Media Composer to perpetually re-render the plug-in.</div><div class="section">The problem of uninitialized memory is obvious. Given a particular plug-in state, Media Composer expects that any retrieved settings chunk will contain matching data regardless of when the chunk is retrieved. When the chunk contains uninitialized data this data does not match between different retrieved chunks. The fix, of course, is to make sure the entire chunk is initialized, for example by setting the entire chunk to zeroes before filling in the data.</div><div class="section">The problem of floating point values is more subtle. Depending on the plug-in's parameter implementation, floating point values may be slightly different in the lowest-order bits when set onto the plug-in as part of an incoming chunk and when subsequently read out. When this occurs, Media Composer sees a mismatch in the chunk data, which causes the AudioSuite plug-in to unexpectedly be seen as requiring a new render.</div><div class="section">AAX plug-in developers will need to avoid both of these conditions in order to maintain compatibility with Media Composer's AudioSuite effect rendering model.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_media_composer_guide__features__unsupported"></a>
Unsupported features</h2>
<div class="section"> The following AAX features are not supported by Media Composer. Plug-ins that require these features will not be compatible with Media Composer. If your plug-ins use these features for advanced functionality but not for basic operation then you should document this restriction for Media Composer users.</div><div class="section"><ul class="paragraphs">
<li>
<div class="SectionHead">Advanced audio routing </div> Media Composer has a simplified audio topology with only tracks and a single master fader. There are no side chains, no busses, and no submasters. As a result, Media Composer does not support extended routing options such as <a class="el" href="a00338.html">Sidechain Inputs</a> or <a class="el" href="a00339.html">Auxiliary Output Stems</a>  </li>

<div class="SectionHead">Transport interface </div> Media Composer does not fully support the <a class="el" href="a00116.html">AAX_ITransport</a> interface.

Audio Engine features and behavior</h2>
<div class="section">Media Composer shares the same audio engine as Pro Tools (AAE) and both applications share the same advanced audio processing features. However, some aspects of plug-in operation are different between the two apps.</div><div class="section">Here are some important notes regarding how Media Composer handles plug-in instances within the audio engine: </p><ul>
<li class="Bullet">
Media Composer only runs plug-ins when Media Composer is playing. Unlike Pro Tools, Plug-ins stop processing when Media Composer stops playing.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Media Composer buffer sizes are always 1024 samples, and execution is not strictly linked to real-time. Processing is generally between four and eight frames ahead of when the audio is heard.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Media Composer will render, mix down, and export real-time effects as fast as the processor will allow, typically much faster than real-time, so be careful of introducing real-time dependencies.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Media Composer has a background render capability, so you cannot expect the GUI to be available, or even be possible on the system performing the render.  </li>
<li class="Bullet">
Plug-ins are frequently disposed and re-created on their preset data. This happens with every edit that changes the number, length, or position of playable clips in the timeline.  </li>
</ul>

Debugging AAX plug-ins in Media Composer</h2>
<div class="section"> Media Composer does not support attaching a debugger in order to debug plug-ins while they are loaded within the app. In addition, Avid does not currently provide debuggable "developer build" versions of Media Composer. You must therefore rely on logging information for debugging your plug-ins in Media Composer, or debug your plug-ins using other AAX hosts such as a Pro Tools development build or the DigiShell command-line environment.</div><div class="section">For more information about debugging in Pro Tools and DigiShell, see <a class="el" href="a00360.html#aax_pro_tools_guide_06_debugging_aax_plugins">Debugging AAX plug-ins</a> in the <a class="el" href="a00360.html">Pro Tools Guide</a>.</div><div class="section"></div> <div class="dynheader">
