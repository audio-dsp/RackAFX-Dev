Overview of VENUE</h1>
<div class="section"> VENUE is Avid's product line aimed at live sound users. VENUE systems are modular, with audio engine, control surface, console, I/O, and external GUI units.</div><div class="section"> VENUE offers plug-in racks to utilize the power of AAX DSP plug-ins. As virtual outboard racks inside the VENUE system, the plug-in racks allow users to take their AAX DSP plug-ins out of the studio and into a live performance.</div><div class="section"> <div class="image">

VENUE systems</h1>
<div class="section"> This section will provide a brief overview of Avid's AAX-compatible VENUE systems. For more information about the features, functionality, and use of these systems see the VENUE user documentation.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__systems__s6l"></a>
VENUE | S6L</h2>
<div class="section"> VENUE | S6L is a modular system designed to take on the world's most demanding tours and events with ease. Offering unprecedented processing capabilities - with over 300 processing channels - S6L delivers unrelenting performance and reliability through its advanced engine design and backs it up with modern touchscreen workflows and scalability to meet any challenge.</div><div class="section"> The S6L engine contains dedicated HDX-powered DSPs handling all plug-in processing and supports 64-bit AAX DSP plug-ins.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__systems__s3l"></a>
VENUE | S3L-X</h2>
<div class="section"> The VENUE | S3L-X System is a modular live sound solution including an HDX-powered processing engine, scalable remote I/O, and a EUCON-enabled control surface.</div><div class="section"> At the heart of the S3L system lies the E3 engine. The E3 runs Windows Embedded and a version of VENUE software that can load AAX DSP plug-ins onto a built-in HDX platform. Accompanying the E3 engine is the <a class="el" href="a00363.html#subsubsection__avid_s3">S3</a> control surface and one or more Stage 16 remote I/O boxes.</div><div class="section"> Most system parameters, including plug-ins, can be controlled using either the on-screen VENUE software or directly via encoders on the S3 control surface. When being used as part of a VENUE | S3L-X system, the S3 control surface is divided into three main sections: </p><div class="SectionHead">A - Channel Section</div><p> The Channel section provides control of Input Channels, FX Returns, Output Channels, some channel parameters (such as Input Channel Gain and Aux Send levels), and channel banking. Channels are selected using the channel Select switches next to each fader.</div><div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">B - Channel Control</div><p> The eight Channel Control encoders provide control of processing functions for the currently selected Input or Output Channel. Inserted Dynamics and EQ plug-ins can be selected and adjusted in Channel Control.</div><div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">C - Global Control</div><p> The eight Global Control encoders provide control of system-wide parameters, including control of plug-ins. The Global Control encoders can be placed into Insert Mode, and can then be used to select and adjust any plug-ins.</div><div class="section"> <div class="image">

Using Channel Control</h3>
<div class="section"> If a channel has an EQ, Comp/Lim, or Expander/Gate plug-in inserted on it, it can be controlled using the eight Channel Control encoders. The user can toggle between controlling the built-in Dynamics or EQ processors and the plug-in versions.</div><div class="section"> Each Input and Output Channel has built-in EQ and Comp/Lim processors. Each Input Channel also has a built-in Expander/Gate. To adjust the built-in processors, the user selects a channel, assigns a processing function to Channel Control by pressing the corresponding encoder from the Channel Control main menu, then adjusts the available parameters.</div><div class="section"> <div class="image">

Host environment</h1>
<div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__environment__audio_engine"></a>
Audio engine</h2>
<div class="section"> The audio engine in VENUE is based around Avid's HDX technology. Each VENUE S6L and S3L System contains a specialized HDX core card. For more information about HDX, see the <a class="el" href="a00362.html">TI Guide</a>. Because the VENUE architecture is so similar to HDX, AAX DSP plug-ins are cross-compatible with VENUE and most plug-ins will run seamlessly on VENUE with little or no modification.</div><div class="section"> Each VENUE system operates at a single native sample rate. VENUE supports multiple processing block sizes at this sample rate. Like in Pro Tools | HDX systems, each DSP chip in the system will only be able to load plug-ins using a single block size; plug-ins which process using different block sizes cannot be allocated to the same DSP.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__environment__dsp_resources"></a>
Available DSP resources</h2>
<div class="section"> The following information reflects plug-in processing abilities of VENUE systems: </p><ul class="paragraphs">
<li>
<div class="SectionHead">S3L-X</div> <ul>
<li>
4 TI C6727 DSP chips are available for plug-in processing </li>

</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__environment__operating_system"></a>
Operating system</h2>
<div class="section"> The core host software in a VENUE system is built upon Windows Embedded 8. The installation used on VENUE systems is a customized version of Windows 8 that includes only what is necessary for the VENUE software.</div><div class="section"> Core services from Windows 8 are available, such as the Win32 API, but some advanced services may not be available. Such services include MIDI, printing, video codec, .NET, etc. If your code relies on advanced Win32 APIs, or you are in doubt about specific APIs, please contact Avid for more information.</div><div class="section"> Using unavailable services may cause a plug-in to not load (e.g. if it attempts to link against DLLs that aren't included in the Windows Embedded 8 image) or to fail during run-time. Whenever possible, before using any advanced Win32 API, you should verify the availability of the service and/or handle the fact that the service might not be functional.</div><div class="section"> See the <a class="el" href="a00377.html#aax_venue_guide__installer">VENUE Plug-in installer specification</a> section for more information about ensuring that all required run-time components are available to your plug-in.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="aax_venue_guide__environment__display"></a>

AAX feature support and compatibility</h1>
<div class="section"> VENUE supports many of the same AAX features as Pro Tools. However, some features are not available in VENUE, and other features are managed differently between the two applications. This section describes how VENUE handles various optional AAX features.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__features__processing"></a>
Processing configurations</h2>
<div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">Architectures</div><p> VENUE supports 64-bit AAX DSP plug-ins only. AAX Native and AAX Hybrid plug-ins are not supported. Plug-ins compiled for 32-bit processors are not supported, though they may be included in a VENUE-compatible .aaxplugin bundle alongside the plug-in's 64-bit binary.</div><div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">Stem formats</div> <ul>
<li>
Mono plug-ins may be inserted as channel inserts on mono input strips and output busses. </li>
<li>
Stereo plug-ins can be inserted as channel inserts on stereo input strips and output busses. </li>
<li>
Greater-than-stereo formats are not supported by VENUE </li>
<li>
Multi-mono processing is not supported; an operator must use the stereo version of a plug-in in stereo processing locations. </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">Width-changing plug-ins</div><p> Width Changing plug-ins are not allowed as inserts except in mix busses. Unlike in Pro Tools, a plug-in cannot change the output stem format of a strip or bus by using a mono-to-stereo plug-in on a mono track.</div><div class="section"> However, width-changing plug-ins are supported on output busses. For these, the outputs of the plug-in can either be routed back to an FX return or routed out to physical outputs. This functionality does not require any additional implementation specific to VENUE.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__features__presets"></a>
Presets and automation</h2>
<div class="section"> Plug-In settings are persisted (saved &amp; restored) the same way for Show files, snapshots &amp; settings files, using a single method to extract settings and a single method to apply setting. The code uses the "chunk" APIs. That's similar to what Pro Tools does, except that for automation, VENUE uses exclusively snapshots (that is, VENUE does not record &amp; playback individual control changes).</div><div class="section"> Many VENUE snapshots users are known to store settings for every Plug-In in every snapshot (or almost). This causes performance issues because settings are often fairly slow to load, making a snapshot recall last too long (sometimes 30 seconds or more!) whereas users expect a snapshot recall to take instantly. However, extremely frequently, settings are not actually changing from a snapshot to the next one (that is, from one snapshot to the next one, the vast majority of Plug-Ins contain the same settings). To mitigate this, VENUE calls <a class="el" href="a00061.html#a1e86f849e970c9998313fc7d451ccf85">AAX_IEffectParameters::CompareActiveChunk()</a> to determine whether a chunk from an incoming snapshot would result in any change to the plug-in's current settings. If not, the new chunk will not be loaded onto the plug-in. This optimization is extremely effective, but requires that Plug-Ins implement the <a class="el" href="a00061.html#a1e86f849e970c9998313fc7d451ccf85">CompareActiveChunk()</a> method properly at any time (in particular regardless of whether the plug-in is visible or not). With VENUE, you must implement this API very well or the Plug-In may not be controllable. This optimization will affect settings application when a show is loaded, when presets are loaded and when snapshots are recalled.</div><div class="section"> All chunks are first compared one by one to the active chunks, until one is different or an error is returned. If any chunk compare fails (not equal or error returned), then all chunks are sent in sequence.</div><div class="section"> As it is the basic method for plug-in settings manipulation, it is critical that plug-ins process chunks as accurately and efficiently as possible.</div><div class="section"> <div class="SectionHead">Plug-In Chunks</div><p> The size of a plug-in chunk cannot exceed 64KB in VENUE. If a Plug-In requires more than 64KB of chunk data total (all chunk sizes added), settings for this plug-in won't be persisted, snapshots won't work for this plug-in and users won't be able to load or save settings. If you can not meet this requirement, you should detect that you are running on VENUE and not declared the process type as it won't be usable.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__features__unsupported"></a>

<li>
Download a VENUE Plug-in Installer(s) in a form of archive (Zip is suggested). Is it ok to have multiple plug-ins in one archive as soon as each plug-in is in own VENUE Plug-in Installer (i.e. in own .aaxplugin folder).  </li>
<li>
Unpack archive and copy installers to USB drive in the following way: <ol>
<li>
"AAX Plug-Ins" folder must be placed in the root of USB drive.  </li>
<li>
Each installer needs to be copied directly the "AAX Plug-Ins" folder. In the end, resulting folder structure will look like this: <div class="image">

Additional plug-in guidelines</h1>
<div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__guidelines__reliability"></a>
General Reliability and Fault Tolerance</h2>
<div class="section"> Since VENUE is a more "mission critical" type of application where there is no room for error during a live show, additional precautions have to be taken with respect to reliability of its various components. We have built provisions in VENUE to protect the system from catastrophic failure due to a plug-in crashing and bringing down the entire system. On top of this, extra care should be taken in developing stable software when targeting VENUE as a platform.</div><div class="section"> If a plug-in crashes, the user will be warned through a dialog. A crash brings down all plug-in processes, but audio keeps flowing through the console and through the DSPs, including the plug-ins' DSPs. All the effects continue to be effective, but their parameters can't be accessed or modified anymore (the show goes on...).</div><div class="section"> At this point, audio should be totally unaffected, even for the effect that caused the crash (assuming the crash took place in the host code, not the DSP code, of course). At the user's discretion, all plug-ins will be bypassed or muted (depending on where they are used in the system), any dependencies on the plug- ins' DSPs will be removed, the plug-ins' DSPs will be reset, and all the plug-ins will start again. When the rebuilding operation is complete, the user will be prompted to decide when he wishes the new plug-ins to be connected.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__guidelines__dialogs"></a>
Plug-In Dialogs</h2>
<div class="section"> Plug-ins should avoid invoking dialog windows in VENUE. We strongly suggest that any unnecessary dialog window your plug-in creates, whether at installation or instantiation, be removed. For VENUE-only plug-ins, we strongly suggest to not make use of any dialog windows.</div><div class="section"> Should you nevertheless need to make use of additional windows or dialogs, you need to make sure that they are front-most, so that they will not be hidden behind VENUE's GUI. The VENUE software will try to force your windows to be front-most, but it is safer if your plug-in enforces this in the first place.</div><div class="section"></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="subsection__aax_venue_guide__guidelines__help"></a>
Online Help</h2>
<div class="section"> VENUE currently doesn't include any standardized help menu for plug-ins. We recommend that you use tooltips and other "live" help techniques similar to what plug-ins like ReVibe II, Reverb One, and Smack! use to help the user. For instance, when a user clicks on the "Side-Chain EQ" label of the Smack! Plug-In, here's what they see:</div><div class="section"> <div class="image">

Plug-in installation</h3>
<div class="section"> These are the steps followed by VENUE when installing a plug-in: </p><ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">First, a VENUE plug-in installer is cached. This is done by copying a plug-in from installation source to the Cached VENUE Plug-In Installers location. All files are copied with an exception of the "Documentation" and "Pro Tools" folders.</p>
<p class="endli">All of the following steps are executed from the cached installer location, not from the original source location.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The pre-install batch script ("Install_before.bat"), if present, is executed. Execution assumes running the script without a console window.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The pre-install script must not contain any installation steps, since it's executed before the plug-in license is accepted. In general, you should only use the pre-install script for pre-install checks.  </dd></dl>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The pre-install executable ("Install_before.exe"), if present, is executed. Execution assumes running the executable without a console window.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The pre-install executable must not perform any installation steps, since it's executed before the plug-in license is accepted. In general, you should only use the pre-install script for pre-install checks.  </dd></dl>
</li>
<li>
A license ("License.rtf" or "License.txt"), if present, is shown to the user. If "License.rtf" is not found, "License.txt" is used. A license, if present, must be accepted by user; otherwise installation will be aborted.  </li>
<li>
All files of the VENUE plug-in installer are copied to the system Installed Plug-Ins location, keeping the .aaxplugin folder structure. Failure to copy any of the items results in installation being aborted.  </li>
<li>
If the plug-in installer contains a subfolder named "Program Files", its contents are copied into "C:\\Program Files". Failure to copy any of items results in installation being aborted.  </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">If the plug-in installer contains a subfolder named "Contents\\Factory Presets", its contents are imported as plug-in presets. The "Factory Presets" folder must contain only valid plug-in .tfx preset files in an arbitrary folder structure. All preset files are read and copied into the system's Factory Presets location.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is important for a plug-in installer to contain only plug-in presets corresponding to plug-in being installed.  </dd></dl>
</li>
<li>
Plug-in thumbnails, if present, are copied from the "Thumbnails" subfolder of the installer to the system Plug-in Thumbnails location.  </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Registry files, if any, are imported. Every file with .reg extension in the root of plug-in installer is treated as a Windows Registry file and gets imported by calling</p>
<div class="TextInd1"><code>regedit /s "&amp;lt;file.reg&amp;gt;"</code></div><p class="endli">No error checking is performed.  </p>

<li>
The post-install batch script ("Install_after.bat"), if present, is executed. Execution assumes running the script without a console window.  </li>

The pre-uninstall executable ("Uninstall_before.exe"), if present, is executed. Execution assumes running the executable without a console window. NO return code is examined. Instead, an executable is allowed to report an error string that will be visible to Avid support when examining VENUE log files. The error needs to be added to Windows registry as a <code>REG_SZ</code> value in <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Digidesign\tmp</em> and named <em>InstallResult</em>. The presence of this string means an error has occurred and a plug-in uninstallation will abort.  </li>

Metering</h2>
<div class="section"> For metering displays, VENUE uses dB units referenced to VENUE's nominal operating level of +4dBu. A signal at the nominal level in VENUE (i.e. registers 0dB on the VENUE meters) will, at unity gain, generate a +4dBu analog output signal (-20dBFS digital output signal).</div><div class="section"> As a result, a signal that registers +20dB on the VENUE meters will register 0dBFS on the plug-in meters. A signal at 0 dB in VENUE will be -20dBFS in the plug-in.</div><div class="section"> To map between dBFS units used in plug-ins and dB units used in VENUE the operator simply needs to add 20 to any plug-in dBFS value.</div><div class="section"></div> <div class="dynheader">
