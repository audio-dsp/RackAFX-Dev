/** @defgroup AuxInterface_HostProcessor Offline processing interface
	@ingroup AdditionalFeatures
	
	@brief Advanced offline processing features
		
		<EM>This interface represents an optional component that you can add to your plug-in in order to
		support extended features of the %AAX SDK.</EM>

		The HostProcessor interface provides offline plug-ins with useful offline processing features
		such as random-access facilities and a non-processing analysis callback. For documentation,
		see the following classes:
		- \ref AAX_CHostProcessor "Host processor module"
		- \ref AAX_IACFHostProcessorDelegate "Host processor delegate"
		
		To add this interface to your plug-in at describe time, register a
		\ref AAX_IEffectDescriptor::AddProcPtr "ProcPtr" using the
		\ref kAAX_ProcPtrID_Create_HostProcessor selector.
		
		\note
		If your plug-in does not require the specific offline processing features provided by this
		interface then it should not register a host processor. Instead, register an offline version
		of the plug-in's real-time algorithm using the \ref AAX_eProperty_PlugInID_AudioSuite property.
