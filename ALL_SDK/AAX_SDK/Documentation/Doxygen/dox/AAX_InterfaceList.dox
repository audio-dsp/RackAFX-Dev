	These interfaces are implemented by the %AAX Host. References to the host-managed

	\ref IACFUnknown::QueryInterface().

/**	@page aax_plugin_implementation Interfaces Implemented by the AAX Plug-In
	@ingroup aax_interfacelist

	These interfaces must be implemented by the %AAX plug-in. Default implementations are
	provided in the %AAX Library via the \c AAX_C classes. Plug-in classes may inherit from
	the \c AAX_C classes to override the default behavior.

/**	@page aax_sdk_internal Interfaces internal to the AAX SDK
	@ingroup aax_interfacelist
	
	These classes and interfaces are used internally within the %AAX Library. References to
	objects implementing these classes are never passed between the plug-in and the %AAX
	Host, and the %AAX Host has no knowledge of these classes.
