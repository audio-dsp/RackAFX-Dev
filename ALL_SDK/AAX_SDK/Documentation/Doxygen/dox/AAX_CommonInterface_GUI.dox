	@brief The interface for a %AAX Plug-in's user interface
	
		The \ref AAX_IEffectGUI "GUI interface" includes methods for handling the plug-in's
		GUI window and events.
		
	\par Accessing the window
	
		In %AAX, the plug-in's window is provided as a native window pointer through the
		\ref AAX_IViewContainer interface.  The plug-in may also use this interface to forward
		events in its window back to the host for handling.
		
	\par Default implementation
		
		A default implementation of the GUI interface, \ref AAX_CEffectGUI, is compiled in to the
		%AAX library.  This class includes a few helper methods and other extensions to the base 
		interface.  Of particular note are several additional pure virtual methods that are used by
		this class to extend the GUI API, and which must be overridden by any inheriting class.
		
	\par Extensions
	
		The %AAX SDK includes several examples of how the basic GUI interface may be extended to
		support native or third-party GUI frameworks.  These examples are not a core part of the
		SDK, but are provided to developers as a convenience when incorporating their own chosen
		GUI framework.
