\section knownissues_aaxsdk Known Issues in the AAX SDK

\subsection AAXSDK-561
An %AAX Hybrid DSP plug-in with 7.1.2 input and output stem formats and a 16-sample processing buffer size will throw an AAE -14382 error upon instantiation at 192kHz

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection AAXSDK-599
In the Win32 GUI example plug-in, the mouse cursor disappears when text is entered in text box and only re-appears when the mouse is moved out of the plug-in window bounds

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection AAXSDK-533
AAXLibrary compiles with warnings in Visual Studio 2015

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.3.0

\subsection AAXSDK-514
Using collection-level properties leads to a leaked ACF object

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.3.0

\subsection AAXSDK-321
Demo Delay (mono) DSP / Demo Gain (Cocoa UI) (mono) DSP can't be instantiated

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.2.0

\subsection AAXSDK-271
DemoMIDI_Sampler: No audio on right channel (multi-mono)

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.2.0

Discussion:
DemoMIDI_Sampler and DemoMIDI_Synth are now restricted to not use multi-mono, via the \ref AAX_eProperty_Constraint_MultiMonoSupport property.

In Pro Tools, when a track's MIDI destination is set to "none" and a new plug-in that includes a MIDI input node (e.g. any Instrument plug-in) is instantiated, the track's MIDI destination is set to the first newly created MIDI input node.

When the track in question is greater than mono, and the Instrument plug-in is multi-mono, the default behavior is for the track's MIDI destination to be set to the first of the newly created input nodes, not to all of them simultaneously. As a result, the track's MIDI destination is set to the MIDI input node of the first (left) multi-mono instance of the plug-in.

To route MIDI to all channels of a multi-mono plug-in in Pro Tools, ctrl-select the MIDI destination and choose the additional MIDI nodes.

\subsection AAXSDK-186
C99Compatibility constructs are incorrect when used with VS2012

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.1.1

\subsection AAXSDK-162
Misleading warning message when attempting hardware debugging using a non-local TIShell.out

The "Load ProTools Plug-in Symbols" script gives the following warning:
<TT>D:/Code_7/dev.ws.backup-win7-concert/AAX/Internal/SystemSoftware/TIShell/CCS_Project/TIShell/../../../../../../WinBag/x64/Release/bin/TIShell.out does not exist! Please question everything.</TT>

This error message includes a hard-coded path that is not relevant to the running system. This error is benign but it can be confusing.

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection AAXSDK-16
%AAX SDK: Win32 example plug-in GUI does not appear in Windows 8

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.2.0

\subsection AAXSDK-14
%AAX DemoGain_VST: Text box entry is not acknowledged upon click outside of window

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection AAXSDK-13 AAXSDK-13 / AAX-579 / PTSW-158381
%AAX SDK Win32 example plug-in does not "snap to default" on option-click

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.2.0

\subsection AAXSDK-11 AAXSDK-11 / AAX-581 / PTSW-158348
%AAX SDK VSTGUI example plug-in does not respond to 'alt' or 'win' modifier keys (Windows)

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 2.2.0

\subsection AAXSDK-10 AAXSDK-10 / AAX-580 / PTSW-154083
%AAX DemoGain_VST and DemoGain_Cocoa require initial click on GUI to take focus before editing (OS X)

Resolution:
This bug is not yet resolved.  For OS X, one workaround is to modify VSTGUI's
cocoasupport.mm file in order to add a handler for the acceptsFirstMouse selector:

  \code{.mm}
  static BOOL VSTGUI_NSView_acceptsFirstMouse(
    id self,
    SEL _cmd)
  {
    return YES;
  }

  // In VSTGUI_NSView_isOpaque()
  res = class_addMethod(
    viewClass,
    @selector(acceptsFirstMouse:),
    IMP (VSTGUI_NSView_acceptsFirstMouse),
    "B@:@:");
  \endcode

Special thanks to Nick Protokowicz for suggesting this workaround.

\subsection AAXSDK-6 AAXSDK-6 / AAX-646
%AAX SDK: Incorrect output from scatter/gather DMA example plug-in when increasing playback buffer size while audio is present (Native decks)

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

Workaround:
The workaround for this issue is to not run audio through this plug-in while increasing the playback buffer size.

\subsection AAXSDK-5
\ref AAX_CChunkDataParser::LoadChunk doesn't handle unknown chunk items well

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

Discussion:
\ref AAX_CChunkDataParser does not store the size of each chunk item in the data stream. Therefore there is no way to determine the correct size for each data element when reading a chunk that was generated by this parser.

Workaround:
If you know the correct size of each data element in a chunk when it is read by the plug-in, you can override the \ref AAX_CChunkDataParser methods to ensure that each data element is correctly sized.

\subsection AAXSDK-2 AAXSDK-2 / AAX-648
%AAX SDK: Output from DMA example plug-in is one buffer early

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection AAX-582 AAX-582 / PTSW-157726
%AAX SDK example plug-ins' controls do not write automation properly when in 'touch' mode (frequently revert to default value while writing)

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of the 1.0.4 SDK

\subsection AAX-585 AAX-585 / PTSW-157451
%AAX DemoGain GUI example plug-ins do not correctly handle alt/opt-click for resetting controls to their default state

Resolution:
This bug is partially resolved as of %AAX SDK 1.0.4.  See also PTSW-158348 and PTSW-158381.

\subsection AAX-578 AAX-578 / PTSW-158310
%AAX SDK JUCE example plug-in does not "snap to default" on option-click

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of %AAX SDK 1.0.4

Pro Tools may incorrectly change a plug-in instance when another instance is edited

Resolution:
This bug is fixed in Pro Tools 2018.1

Discussion:
This issue only happens when the two plug-in types use the same Manufacturer and Plug-In IDs and use Product IDs with unprintable chars when interpreted as four-char values.

We strongly recommend that you select Product IDs in the printable ASCII four-char range.

\subsection PTSW-197431 PTSW-197431 / PT-218414
Pro Tools 10: Plug-in Side-chain input is silent when the plug-in supports Aux Outputs

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-197075

\subsection PTSW-195316 PTSW-195316 / PT-218485
EQ/Dyn graphs on EUCON surfaces are not always updated for plug-ins with many EQ/Dyn parameters

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

Discussion:
Currently, EUCON surfaces only update a plug-in's EQ/Dyn curve plots when an update occurs to one of the parameters which is mapped to the plug-in's "center section" EQ/Dyn page tables. Other parameters will not trigger an update to the plug-in's EQ/Dyn curve plot.

\subsection PTSW-195257
Calling \ref AAX_ICollection::AddEffect() multiple times using the same \c iEffectID only returns an error if called with the same \ref AAX_IEffectDescriptor "effect descriptor", but this is always illegal

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 12

Discussion:
Calling \ref AAX_ICollection::AddEffect() using the same ID will now return an error in all cases

\subsection PTSW-195256 PTSW-195256 / PT-218429
Plug-in is not notified of preset load when loading factory default presets

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-195209 PTSW-195209 / PT-218474

Discussion:
This bug was introduced in Pro Tools 11.1

\subsection PTSW-194698 PTSW-194698 / PT-218478
Very hard to edit plug-in parameters with many steps using a control surface rotary encoder

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-194231 PTSW-194231 / PT-218434
When the output on a track is set to "no output" then no audio is sent to Auxiliary Outputs of the plug-ins on the track

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved 

Workaround:
Users can work around this issue by ensuring that a track output is always assigned for tracks with plug-ins that generate Auxiliary Output channels. For example, the user may pull down the track's output gain fader, enable MUTE, or select an unused output channel or bus.

\subsection PTSW-193646
AudioSuite plug-ins are not able to partially re-name clips

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 12

\subsection PTSW-193400

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 11.2

\subsection PTSW-193345
AudioSuite processing notifications are not sent at the start and end of a processing event

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 12

Discussion:
Two new notifications were added to provide this behavior. The existing AudioSuite notifications retain their behavior: they are sent before and after each processing pass, i.e. at the beginning and end of each audio channel that is processed, even if the current selection includes multiple channels. For more information, see \ref AAX_EProcessingState

\subsection PTSW-193339
Pro Tools does not update plug-in settings when a new setting's name matches an old setting and the modification date is later

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

Workaround:
To update the settings that are bundled with a plug-in, the plug-in's installer should search for and remove any deprecated settings files on the system.

\subsection PTSW-193051
Using Aux Output Stems on DSP plug-ins causes them to crash

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 11.2

Discussion:
This bug was introduced in Pro Tools 11.1

\subsection PTSW-192863 PTSW-192863 / PT-218498
Plug-in side chain input is not properly delay compensated: aligned with output instead of input, no individual tap per insert

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

Discussion:
Side chain delay compensation on native playback engines is not currently supported

\subsection PTSW-192755
Key focus is not returned to a plug-in after it launches a dialog

Resolution: 
This bug will not be fixed (design limitation)

\subsection PTSW-192720 PTSW-192720 / PT-218467
External source (SideChain) key input is not reported to DSP Dynamics plug-ins after HDX re-shuffle, hence no Gain Reduction occurs.

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved

\subsection PTSW-192635
Implement Manufacturer ID byteswap

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 11.2 and Pro Tools 10.3.10

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 11.1.2

\subsection PTSW-190722
Some plug-in state changes do not trigger the Pro Tools session "dirty" flag

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tool 11.1.2 and and Pro Tools 10.3.9

\subsection PTSW-190719
Unexpected behavior for plug-in auxiliary output channels > 128

Resolution:
This bug will be fixed as of Pro Tools 11.1.3

\subsection PTSW-190340
In some cases %AAX plug-ins do not show the correct Control Name Variation on control surfaces

This bug can occur when a page table references parameters by ID and some parameters' ID strings are exactly as long as the control surface's display. In this scenario, the control surface will display the parameter's ID string rather than a Control Name Variations (abbreviation) string of equivalent length.

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 12

\subsection PTSW-189928 PTSW-189928 / PT-218456
Failure to load %AAX plug-ins with spaces in DLL filename

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-189725 PTSW-189725 / PT-218397
Auto-generated AudioSuite plug-in GUIs are non-functional for the first plug-in loaded into the window

This bug applies to AudioSuite plug-ins wich use the \ref AAX_eProperty_UsesClientGUI property. This bug is present in all Pro Tools versions which support %AAX.

Workaround:
This bug only applies when an AudioSuite window is first created. To resolve the issue, toggle an open AudioSuite window between different plug-ins. After toggling to another plug-in and back to the original plug-in, the auto-generated GUI will again be functional.

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-189439 PTSW-189439 / PT-218427
Attempts to set signal latency by non-linear AudioSuite plug-ins should fail, but do not

Pro Tools has a problem with \ref AAX_IController::PostPacket() being called during \ref AAX_IEffectParameters::TimerWakeup()

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

Workaround:
This bug occurs only with unbuffered plug-ins' ports for coefficients, so the workaround for this issue is to use buffered ports instead.

\subsection PTSW-187159
Plug-in parameters can get stuck in touched state; touch/release tokens do not always match

One race condition that could result in this bug behavior has been addressed in Pro Tools 11.1.0. However, the bug can still occur when using EUCON control surfaces due to a mismatch in touch/release tokens sent from those surfaces.

Resolution:
This bug is resolved as of Pro Tools 11.1.3. It is unresolved in Pro Tools 10

%AAX: Calls to \ref AAX_CParameter<>::SetValue() "SetValue()" early in plug-in life may not propagate to \ref AAX_IACFEffectParameters::UpdateParameterNormalizedValue() "UpdateParameterNormalizedValue()"

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

The workaround for this issue is to call SetValue redundantly until the desired value is updated.

\subsection PTSW-185867 PTSW-185867 / PT-218470
Session tempo should be available during \ref AAX_CEffectParameters::EffectInit "EffectInit()"

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed 

Workaround:
The workaround for this issue is to poll the transport interface in \ref AAX_IACFEffectParameters::TimerWakeup() "TimerWakeup()" or otherwise call it after \ref AAX_CEffectParameters::EffectInit "EffectInit()" completes.

\subsection PTSW-185866
Pro Tools does not respond to \ref AAX_IACFEffectParameters::SetParameterNormalizedValue() "SetParameterNormalizedValue()" while offline bouncing

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 11.1. However, note that we do not recommend implementing linked parameters using direct calls to \ref AAX_IACFEffectParameters::SetParameterNormalizedValue() "SetParameterNormalizedValue()". For an explanation of the correct approach to parameter linking, see \ref advancedTopics_linkedParameters, with examples provided in the SDK example plug-ins.

\ref AAX_IHostProcessorDelegate::GetAudio() ignores input audio buffer parameter

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed 

The workaround for this issue is to make sure that HostProcessor plug-ins only request valid audio - do the boundary-condition checking inside the plug-in.

\subsection PTSW-183841

\subsection PTSW-183708
AudioSuite: plug-in parameters are not changed upon 1st click after you click Bypass. [Win]

Resolution:
This was found to be an issue in certain plug-ins with JUCE-based GUI implementations. In JUCE, the real-time variants of the of the modifiers key getter method can cause seemingly unrelated problems with the responsiveness of the GUI. In this instance, the symptom was that plug-in parameters would not be changed on the first click inside the GUI window.

The workaround for this issue, and for other unusual GUI behavior in these plug-ins, is to always use <TT>juce::ModifierKeys::getCurrentModifiers()</TT>; do not use <TT>juce::ModifierKeys::getCurrentModifiersRealtime()</TT>.

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed

\subsection PTSW-158119
Some plug-ins' DSP Instance counts are much lower in Pro Tools 10.2 than in Pro Tools 10.1

Resolution:
This issue affects plug-ins that employ more than one buffered data port and that
support many instances per DSP chip on HDX.  As of Pro Tools 10.2, there is a limit of
164 buffered data ports per DSP (this is equal to the total I/O limit per DSP.)

To work around this issue, use as few data ports in your plug-in's algorithm context as
possible.  Note that DMA transfers on HDX occur in 128-byte chunks, so packet sizes
below 128 bytes do not increase transfer efficiency on HDX.

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Pro Tools 10.2

\subsection PTSW-155300 PTSW-155300 / PT-218458
When an AudioSuite plug-in modifies the output audio length, the audio is not positioned at the correct location

This bug is due to AudioSuite handles processing. A plug-in that modifies the output audio length may move audio from the handle region into the visible clip region, which is unexpected behavior from the user's perspective.

Resolution:
This bug will not be fixed 

The workaround is for plug-ins that experience this issue to disable AudioSuite handles, thereby only processing the audio that the user sees on the timeline.

\subsection PTSW-155177
<TT>eFicGestalt_GetASPreHandleLength</TT> and <TT>eFicGestalt_GetASPostHandleLength</TT> return the wrong handle length values upon a call to <TT>AnalyzeAudio</TT> with 'WHOLE FILE' mode selected

\subsection PTSW-153140
Crash on Pro Tools quit when plug-in GUI is open (OSX)

Resolution:
This bug is unresolved in Pro Tools and will not be fixed for the foreseeable future.  
Plug-in workarounds are demonstrated in the DemoGain_GUIExtensions example plug-ins:

  a) Separating all Obj-C elements into a separate bundle that is loaded manually
     by the main plug-in bundle (see DemoGain_Cocoa)
  b) Applying an NSAutoreleasePool to the %AAX GUI object destructors (see
     DemoGain_VST and DemoGain_JUCE)

\section knownissues_mc Known Issues in Media Composer

\subsection MCDEV-2904
Optional analysis is not applied to every channel in a multi-channel selection

Resolution:
This bug is fixed as of Media Composer 8.4

Discussion:
When an optional analysis pass is triggered in Media Composer, only the channel that is currently represented in the AudioSuite Dialog will be analyzed. Other channels in a multi-channel selection will not be analyzed.

This issue is fixed in Media Composer 8.4; now the following behavior will occur for AudioSuite plug-ins:

\li If a plug-in defines only \ref AAX_eProperty_RequiresAnalysis then an Analyze pass will be performed before Render/Preview and the "Analyze" button will be disabled
\li If a plug-in defines only \ref AAX_eProperty_OptionalAnalysis then an Analyze pass will be performed before Render/Preview as well as when the "Analyze" button is clicked, and the "Analyze" button will be enabled
\li If a plug-in defines both \ref AAX_eProperty_RequiresAnalysis and \ref AAX_eProperty_OptionalAnalysis then an Analyze pass will be performed before Render/Preview as well as when the "Analyze" button is clicked, and the "Analyze" button will be enabled





\section knownissues_cs Known Issues in Control Surfaces

\subsection PT-226228
On EUCON control surfaces, Dynamics curves are not displayed if a plug-in does not provide a custom curve display range

Workaround:
In order for a plug-in's Dynamics curve to be displayed, the plug-in must implement \ref AAX_IEffectParameters::GetCurveDataDisplayRange() for whichever Dynamics \ref AAX_ECurveType "curve types" it supports

\subsection PT-226227
EUCON control surfaces do not support custom EQ curve display ranges
